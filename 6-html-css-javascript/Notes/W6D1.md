## Introduction to HTML

[HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) stands for Hypertext Markup Language - it is a markup language for creating web pages and applications. HTML contains a particular syntax - namely **elements** and **attributes** - that web browsers parse in order to render the content of the webpage. With HTML, the structure and content of a webpage is defined. Styling and dynamic behavior are introduced with CSS and JavaScript, respectively.

### Elements

HTML is composed of many different **elements** - these provide the structure of the document. Elements are defined within HTML files using **tags** - for example, one very common tag is the `<div>` tag. The tag is enclosed within angle brackets. Most elements have a closing tag which define the end of the element, using the backslack notation - for example, a closing "div" tag would be `</div>`. HTML elements may be *nested* within other elements, like so:

```html
<div> text inside the div but outside the paragraph
  <p> this text is inside the paragraph </p>
</div>
```

In order for HTML to be **valid**, tags must be properly nested - an outer tag cannot be closed before an inner one. For example, the following markup would not be considered valid:

```html
<div> invalid!
  <p> cannot close the div here => </div>
</p>
```

Not all elements have closing tags, some are self-closing. For example, the `<img />` tag, which defines an image.

### Attributes

HTML elements can also have **attributes** defined within the tag - these are key/value pairs that give metadata about the tag that are important for the browser to know. For example, image elements must have a URL which the browser can call to retrieve the image file to display on the page - we use the `src` attribute to do this: `<img src="/URL/to/get/cat.png" alt="cool cat!" />`. As you may have guessed, the `alt` attribute specifies an alternative text to show when the image cannot be displayed.

#### Global Attributes

**Global** attributes are those that can be applied to any element on the page. Some important global attributes are:

* class
* id
* hidden
* lang
* style
* tabindex
* title

There are also many attributes that should be applied to only certain elements, including the `src` and `alt` attributes shown above. We'll discuss more about these when relevant.

## Starting HTML Documents

Every HTML document (ending with `.html` extension) should begin with a special tag known as the DOCTYPE declaration - this lets browsers know what kind of document it is using (HTML, in our case) as well as which version of the markup language is being used. For HTML5, the newest version and the one which we'll be using, the DOCTYPE syntax is:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

The doctype declaration tag does not have a closing tag and it is not self-closing either.

Next, the tag which begins the root of our HTML document is the `<html>` tag. Everything about our webpage will be nested within this tag.

Within the `html` element we have two important tags - the `<head>` and the `<body>` tags. The `head` element will contain all the metadata associated with this page, including the title, character encodingg, and references to external stylesheets. The `body` element contains the actual content of our page that will be rendered on the screen by the browser.

### Hello World Example

Let's write a simple webpage that will show off our knowledge of HTML thus far. Open up a new file in a simple text editor and save the file as `hello-world.html`. Then write the following HTML markup and save it:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello World!</title>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div>
      <!-- THIS IS A COMMENT! -->
      <p>This is my first paragraph written in HTML</p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

The only tag you may be unfamiliar with is the `meta` tag above - this defines the character encoding that the file will be using. Also, the `<!-- ... -->` syntax denotes a comment.

If you now open your `hello-world.html` file in your browser of choice, you'll see your webpage rendered. It may look ugly now, but we'll address that when we talk about CSS.

### Common HTML elements

Before listing all the HTML elements available to use, it's important to know the difference between **inline** and **block**-level elements. Block-level elements are those that will render on new lines in blocks by default, instead of rendering within the line itself like inline elements do. One example of a block element is `<div>`, and a common inline element is `<span>`. Try them out on your webpage and notice the difference. 

There are a vast number of HTML elements you could use on your webpage, but below are listed the most common:

* `<div>` - defines a "division of the page"
* `<p>` - defines a paragraph
* `<span>` - an inline tag for grouping text or elements
* `<b>` - bold text
* `<i>` - italicized text
* `<h1>`, `<h2>`, ... `<h6>` - these are headings, h1 is largest and h6 is smallest
* `<br>` - line break
* `<table>` - defines a table
* `<img src="URL">`
* `<ol>` - an ordered list
* `<ul>` - an unordered list
* `<a href="">` - makes a hyperlink

#### Hyperlinks

To make a hyperlink in a webpage, use the `<a>` tag:

```html
<p> Here is a <a href="www.google.com">link to Google!</a></p>
```

#### Tables

To create a table, use the following markup. `<tr>` defines a table row, `<td>` defines a table cell, and `<th>` is used for table headers.

```html
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Id</th>
      <th>Name</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Alice</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>Bob</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>Charlie</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

#### Lists

There are two options for making lists in HTML - ordered or unordered lists. Ordered lists are defined with `<ol>`, unordered lists are defined with `<ul>`, and the list items within either are denoted with `<li>`:

```html
<ol> <!-- ordered lists render as 1, 2, 3, etc.. -->
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
</ol>
<ul> <!-- list items in here will just be bullet points -->
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
</ul>
```

# Document Object Model (DOM)

The Document Object Model is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document.

<img src = "https://miro.medium.com/proxy/0*2u0XVKOE-mRQBPQI.png">

- When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.

- The HTML DOM is constructed as a tree of Objects

- We can access these properties and stylize them with CSS or code their behavior with JS

# CSS
CSS stands for **Cascading Style Sheets** - it is a language for styling HTML documents by specifying certain rules for layout and display in key/value pairs. Style Sheets are a simple and powerful method of allowing attachment of rendering information to HTML documents. It used to style the webpages by setting background-color, font color, font size, font family, etc.

A CSS consists of a *set of rules* that defines the styles for a web page. A CSS style rule composed of **selectors** and **declarations**. The selector is an HTML Element *like h3 used in the below example*. The declaration is comprised of a property and a value surrounded by curly braces. In the below example font-family, font-style and color were properties of the selector h3. Arial, italic and red were the values assigned, respectively, to the properties.

*Example:*
 ```  
    h3 { 
        font-family: Arial; 
        font-style: italic; 
        color: red 
        }
```

# CSS Box Model

The CSS box model used to determine how our web page is rendered by browser. It considers each element on the page as a box, CSS allows you to apply different properties that define where and how that element appears. Web pages are made up of rectangular boxes arranged and related to each other. 

![Box model](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Box-model.svg)

Every box has 4 parts - **margin**, **border**, **padding** and **content**. The margin is an outermost box,  inside that the border, then padding, then the content is innermost. All box sizes/formatting can be styled with CSS.

**Margin**  -   It is a space between border and margin. It is useful to separate the element from its neighbors. The dimensions are given by the margin-box width and the margin-box height. 

**Border** -  It is the area between the box’s padding and margin. Its dimensions are given by the width and height of the border.

**Padding** -  It is a space around the content area and within the border-box. Its dimensions are given by the width of the padding-box and the height of the padding-box.

**Content** -  It consists of content like text, image, or other media content. It is bounded by the content edge and its dimensions are given by content-box width and height.

# Types of CSS

There are three types of CSS which are given below: 
* Inline CSS
* Internal or Embedded CSS
* External CSS

### Inline CSS

Inline CSS contains the CSS property in the body section attached with element is known as inline CSS. This kind of style is specified within an **HTML tag using style attribute**. 

**Example:**

    <!DOCTYPE html> 
    <html> 
    <head> 
        <title>Inline CSS</title> 
    </head> 
    <body> 
        <p style = "color:#009900; 
		   font-size:50px; 
           font-style:italic; 
           text-align:center;">
			            Hello World
	       </p> 
    </body> 
    </html>  
     
### Internal or Embedded CSS

This can be used when a single HTML document must be styled  **uniquely**. The CSS rule set should be within the HTML file in the *head section* i.e the CSS is embedded within the HTML file.

**Example:**
 ```  
    <!DOCTYPE html> 
    <html> 
    <head> 
        <title>Internal CSS</title> 
        <style> 
            .main { 
                text-align:center;  
            } 
            .hi{ 
                color:#009900; 
                font-size:50px; 
                font-weight:bold; 
            } 
            .greeting { 
                font-style:bold; 
                font-size:20px; 
            } 
        </style> 
    </head> 
    <body> 
        <div class = "main"> 
            <div class ="hi"> Hi, Everyone!!</div>   
            <div class ="greeting"> 
                Hello World!! 
            </div> 
        </div> 
    </body> 
    </html>  
 ```           

### External CSS

External CSS contains separate CSS file which contains only style property with the help of tag attributes (For example class, id, heading, … etc). CSS property written in a separate file with .css extension and should be linked to the HTML document using **link** tag. This means that for each element, style can be set only once and  that will be applied across web pages.
 
**Example:** The file given below contains CSS property. This file should be saved with an .css extension. For Ex: **style.css**

```
    body {
	    background-color:powderblue;
	    }
	.main {
	    text-align:center;
	    }
	.hi {
		color:#009900;
	    font-size:50px;
	    font-weight:bold;
	    }
	#greeting {
	    font-style:bold;
	    font-size:20px; 
	    }
```

Below, we have HTML file that makes use of the above created external style sheet (style.css). This can be achieved by using `<link>` tag. The `<link>` element has *rel* and *href* attributes. The *rel* specifices the relationship between the current document and the linked document. In this case, *rel* attribute value will be *stylesheet* because we going to add the external style sheet to the HTML document. The *href*  attribute is used to specify the location of the external style sheet file.

```
    <html>
        <head> 
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"/> 
        </head> 
        <body> 
            <div class = "main"> 
                <div class ="hi"> Hi, Everyone !</div> 
                <div id = "greeting "> 
                    Hello world !!
                </div> 
            </div> 
        </body> 
    </html> 
```
## Element Selector

The element selector selects HTML elements by their name / tag name *like a, h1, div, p etc*.

*Example:* Here, we use `<p>` as an element selector. The text inside the `<p>` will be center-aligned also blue color.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<head>  
<style>  
p {  
    text-align: center;  
    color: blue;  
}   
</style>  
</head>  
<body>  
<p>This style will be applied on every paragraph.</p>  
<p> Here also</p>
</body>
</html>
```
## Class Selector

In the CSS, the class selector is a name preceded by a period (“.”).  It uses the class attribute of an HTML element to match the specific HTML element. We can have a Class selector specific to an HTML element *like we have `p.class` in the below example*.

In the below example, we have two class selectors inside the `<style>` element. The class selector `.intro` is applied to the element which has an attribute called `class`, whose value is `intro` and the `p.intro`  class selector is applied to the `<p>` element which has an attribute called `class`, whose value is `intro`. Also, the `<p>` element without the `class` attribute doesn't get affected.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
.intro {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

p.intro {
  text-align: center;
  color: blue;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1 class="intro">Red and center-aligned heading</h1>
<p class="intro">blue and center-aligned paragraph.</p> 
<p> this will not be affected </p>
</body>
</html>
```

## ID Selector

In the CSS, the ID selector is a name preceded by a hash character (“#”).  It uses the id attribute of an HTML element to match the specific HTML element. The **id** of an element should be unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element. 

*Example:* Here, we use `#para1` as an ID selector. Inside the body, we have two `<p>` elements. The CSS style rule applied to the element which has an attribute called `id`, whose value is `para1`. Therefore, `Hello World!` will be center-aligned also blue color.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
#para1 {
  text-align: center;
  color: blue;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<p id="para1">Hello World!</p>
<p>This paragraph is not affected by the style.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

> *NOTE:* The id name should start with the alphabet, not with numbers. Also, the HTML element without the 'id' attribute doesn't get affected.


### CSS Padding Property

The CSS padding property allow you to set the padding area for an element that separates its border from its content. The padding property can take one, two, three, or four  values separated by white spaces as listed in the below table. Depending on the list of property values, the HTML element has the padding area on the top, bottom, right, and left.

|Examples| Explanation|
|------|-----|
|`p { padding: 70px; }`| Sets the padding for an `<p>` element to 70 pixels for all four sides |
|`p { padding: 35px 70px; }`|Sets the padding for an `<p>` element to 35 pixels for top and bottom and 70 pixels for right and left sides.|
|`p { padding: 35px 70px 40px; }`|Sets the padding for an `<p>` element to 35 pixels for the top, 70 pixels for the left and right side and 40 pixels for the bottom. |
|`p { padding: 35px 70px 40px 80px; }`| Sets the padding for an `<p>` element to 35 pixels for the top, 70 pixels for the right side, 40 pixels for the bottom and 80 pixels for the left side.|

The padding property is a shorthand property for the padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and padding-left properties. The below examples set padding on a specific side for the HTML element.

*Examples*:
```
h1 { 
	padding-bottom: 10px; 
} 
p { 
	padding-top: 20px; 
	padding-left: 50px;
 }
```

### CSS Margin Property

The CSS margin property is similar to the CSS border property,  but it sets the margins around the sides of an element's box instead of the border. It also takes one, two, three, or four values separated by white spaces. 
The shorthand properties are margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, and margin-left to set a margin on respective sides.

*Example:*
```
p {
    margin-left: 10px;
    margin-right: 30px;
}
h1{
    margin: 25px 50px;
}
```

### CSS Display Property

The display property controls the display behaviour of an element.  The CSS display property sets whether an element is treated as a block or inline elements and the layout used for its children, such as flow layout, flex or grid. 

There are two types of HTML elements: **inline-level elements** and **block-level elements**. The differences between these elements affect how you use the box model. 
Both Inline and block-level elements appear within the body of an HTML page. But, inline-level elements are used to create a short structure that can have data and other inline elements. Inline level elements include `<b>`, `<big>`,`< i>`, `<small>`, `<tt>`, `<abbr>`, `<acronym>`, `<code>`, `<strong>`, etc.  
Block-level elements used to create larger structures than inline elements also it starts on new lines by default whereas inline-level elements not. Block elements include `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`,`<h6>`, `<ol>`, `<ul>`, `<pre>`, `<address>`, `<blockquote>`, `<dl>`, `<div>`, `<fieldset>`, `<form>`, `<hr>`, `<table>`, etc .

The Syntax for the display property is `selector {display: value}`. The property values and description with examples are tabulated below:

|Property value | Description | Example|
|------|-----|----|
| block | behaves likes block-level elements| `a {display: block;} `|
| inline| behaves like inline-level elements | ` ul li { display: inline; }`|
|none | elements doesn't generate boxes | ` h1 { display: none;}`|

### CSS Position Property

The position property defines how an element will be arranged on a page. The Syntax for the position property is `selector {position: value}`. The property values are static, relative, absolute, fixed, or inherit.

static - The element's box is arranged automatically consistent with the normal flow.

relative - The element's box position is relative to its normal flow position. You can adjust the normal flow position by using the top, bottom, left and right properties.

absolute - The element's box arranged to an absolute position with reference to its containing block. Its containing block is that the nearest ancestor element that has its position property set to relative, absolute, or fixed. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to set the offset of the element's box with reference to its containing block.

fixed - The element's box position is offset from its browser window by using the top, right, bottom, and left properties. The element's box won't move when the browser window is scrolled.

inherit - The inherit keyword is employed to specify that the value for this property should be taken from the parent element. If inherit is used with the root element, then the initial value for this property is going to be used.

*Example:*
```
a {position: static;}
div {position: relative; top: 20px; left: 50px;}
h1 {position: absolute; top: 30px; left: 20px;}
div {position: fixed; top: 325px; left: 60px;}
```
### CSS Color property
	
The color property is used to specify the foreground color of text.The color properties are set using 5 different color notation types which is listed below:

```
a {color: red;}
div {color: #3c5;}
h1 {color: #ffa500;}
div {color: rgb(100,20,255);}
#id1 {color: rgb(30%,50%,70%);} 
```
 ### CSS text-align property

The text-align property is used to align the content inside the element. The text inside the element can be aligned in 4 ways - left, right, center and justify. 

 *Example:* The text-align properties are set to left, right, justify, and center.
```
 div {text-align:left;}
 h1 {text-align: right;}
  p {text-align: justify;}
  div {text-align: center;}
```
